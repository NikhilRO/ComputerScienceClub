# Computer Science Club

Contains all the materials from the computer science club meetings

Goal of the meetings: Get thinking of algorithms `(series of steps)` to solve any problem. 

## Resources for independent learning:
* [Mr. Seidel's Classes](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes)
  * [Grade 10](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS2O)
  * [Grade 11](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS3U)
  * [Grade 12](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U)
  
* Fundamental Concepts in Computer Science (grabbed from Mr. Seidel's github + more)
  * Variables
  * Conditionals (if...then)
  * Repetition Structures = Loops (for loops, while etc.)
  * Arrays
  * Functions and Encapsulation
  * ArrayLists (in Java)
  * Closure (JavaScript)
  * Objects and Encapsulation
  * Recursion (graphical, and non-graphical)
  * Input/Output
  * Sorting and Searching
  * Stacks and Queues

### Languages and other resources (source: [Mr. Seidel](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U/blob/master/README.md) +some more)

**You are free to learn any language you want. For some contests like [CCC](http://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html), the online grader restricts your choices for languages.** [*The CCC Online Grader currently supports C, C++, Python (2.x and 3.x), Pascal, Java, Perl, and PHP.*](http://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/computing-grader.html) Python and Java are usually safe choices.  

####Processing Language and Resources 
* What is Processing?
  * Processing is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) based on Java. To run a processing sketch on any computer, you will need to install some files. 
* [Processing.org] (http://www.processing.org/) (download, references and examples available on the same site)

####p5.js Language and Resources
* What is p5.js?
  * p5.js is a JavaScript library that adds functionality to core JavaScript. The best thing about p5.js (or JS in general) is that it is supported in any modern browser; so, anyone can easily access your program.

####Markdown resources
* What is Markdown?
  * Markdown is a visually friendly way to write HTML. It has limited functionality but will suffice in most circumstances.
  * `Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).`- [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/), developer behind Markdown
